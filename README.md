**Title:**
Project for helping identify missing people during disasters

**Problem:**
The saddest part of disaster is not about loss of property, it is loss of loved ones. Often, it becomes difficult to identify or find missing people during disasters like flood.

**Solution:**
We are making a **Web application** in which any person who finds someone misssing can contribute by sending the details of that person. There will be a authority which approves that data in our database. On another hand people can send query to get info about their loved ones. We will try to help such people by giving them relevant info from our database.

**Technologies Used:**
Django, Machine Learning libraries
